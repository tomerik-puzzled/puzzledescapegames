COFFEE CUP GAMES
WELCOME TO OUR COFFEE CUP GAMES LANDING PAGE, AND THANK YOU FOR PLAYING OUR GAMES. 

Here’s a little bit of information before you dig in. 

The cups you’ve received can be solved without needing the internet, but if you do want to look up a thing or two, that’s not cheating. 

We do recommend that you begin the online game before starting with the cups if possible. Just because there’s a little bit of a story video and setup. 

If you get STUMPED OR STUCK at any stage of the game, go get a hint or two from the Hints and Solutions page. That being said, the game is hard and is supposed to be hard.   

It requires time and thought to finish the cups alone, and the first online puzzle is a really meaty one. 

The game is designed to be played by 1-3 people over a lazy weekend. 

For the first online part, we recommend that you print out the puzzles. It makes it a lot easier to follow. 

Lastly, for all the online components, we recommend using a computer over a cellphone. That’s it. Get cracking!
